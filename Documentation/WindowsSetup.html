<h1>Windows Setup</h1>

The QUASAR Framework has many dependencies that are common place in a Linux environment, however this is not the case for a Windows one. In this page there are provided instructions on how to install the different dependencies of the framework, and some useful links as well, to help the user find the required programs.
The availability of the links is not guaranteed at all, as they are external links that may become outdated.
